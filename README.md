# gold
Gold is a WIP language which tries to merge all the best practices I've seen in my experience so far: Move-by-default semantics, Automatic non-GCed memory management (like Rust, but with no lifetimes, and with an easy way of preventing the compiler from dropping the object at end of scope, i.e less safe, but more flexible, yet still provides a way bigger degree of safety than C/C++, since we drop by default at end of scope), no nulls (unless working with raw pointers, which should be only in unsafe code), and implicit function application. The project was started recently, so the current stage is just parsing. As this is a long-term side project (years, possibly), this will take a long while and a big effort. Also, the project must be dependency-free (realistically, it should not rely on anything more than rust nightly and rust nightly's own dependencies, libc, or the msvc toolchain etc).

After an initial step of the parsing and semantic analysis is done, the project will move on to original LLVM integration, and then restart a parsing-semantic-codegen part. The current target is to get simple expressions done in the language, after which packs, enums, and the type system will follow, after which more advanced features too: auto-cast, compile-time execution possibly if it is feasible, implicits etc.

A small language draft is avaialable at ./gold_draft.txt
